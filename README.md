**Retrospection**

**What sort of problems did we encounter?**

- Mocking and where to use mocking. A large a bulk of our time was spent trying to understand Jest and its automock vs manual mock function.

- Lack of full planning due to the nature of the exercise led to character.js holding a lot of the functionality.

**What have you learned, any new techniques?**

- Improved Javascript TDD. Gained understanding of Jest syntax and how creating functions within tests can lead to better testing.

- Improved understanding of mocking, jest.fn() \*.mockClear...

- Dependency injection - improved understanding how classes interact with one another.

**Improvements for the future**

- It would be fun to explore some front end functionality, look into stuff like animation and just to explore how far we could take the project.
